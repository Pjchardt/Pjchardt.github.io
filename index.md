<div class="right">
  <h3 align="left">Welcome</h3>
  <p>I uses digital game development, hardware reappropriation, emerging technology, and play to foster discourse on emerging computational technology.</p>
  <p>My work has been exhibited at events such as IndieCade, ALT.CTRL.GDC, FILE, and Smithsonian Indie Arcade. In 2016 I won Gold Prize in the Oculus Mobile Virtual Reality competition. I have also been awarded numerous grants for my work at the local level developing projects such as; ARTiculation - an interactive exhibit for children, and Rules & Play - a curated show of interactive works I created in 2015. I live in Kentucky most of the year.</p>
