There was a grasshopper with the head of a dog on the airplane I rode into New York City. What really spiked my tea though was that it was the head of MY dog. I called home and my dog is okay, somehow this asshole made a life size realistic replica of my dog and wore it THE WHOLE TIME from Lexington to NYC just...why? To upset me? Anyway it made for a nice sunrise so I made art out of it.

*Next up we have some computer art. Exhibit one:*

I went to the Mana Contemporary in Jersey City today. They had a large collection of Warhol screenprints. I was looking at his series of Mao and it struck me they looked like defaced money, which got me thinking...that son of a bitch figured out how to print money. Literally, that willy fella made his own vibrant, oversized, spectacualr currency complete with famous folks adornig the bills. Inspired I wrote a poem.
