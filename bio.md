          I began as a traditional printmaker. Then I made games. As a consequence of my career developing digital games I became an entrepreneur, building two boutique style interactive software companies. Now I write code, hack on hardware, and perform.

        In my practice I utilize the tools of game design, entrepreneurialism, emerging technologies, and installation/demonstration. My work takes the form of projects, each project encompassing research, open sourced material, and one or more works. These works manifest as interactive installations and  software applications.

        In the past, much of my work was presented at exhibitions and festivals, such as FILE, Smithsonian, ALT.CTRL.GDC, and IndieCade. Recently, I have been active showing in galleries and alternative spaces.
