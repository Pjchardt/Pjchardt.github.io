  <h4 align="left">no signal</h4>
  <p>
    Video projection that combines "real" shadows from physical objects and "faux" shadows generated by the software. The installation appears to be inactive, but in fact a simulation is running with a 3d human model that wanders about a virtual space, their shadow sometimes coming into view on the screen.
