  <h3 align="left">Re:contextualization</h3>
  <p>While I participated in an artist group discussion of recontextualization of objects/art a camera streamed our meeting to a screen in the gallery of the building upstairs. When the discussion was winding down, I informed the group of the camera and video feed in the gallery, which created a gestalt recontextualization of the space for each member of the group.</p>
