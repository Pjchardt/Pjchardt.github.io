        <p style="color: #fff; text-align: left;">ODLKAP is an online database of paintings and associated meta-data, e.g. images, artist name, title, and year. The paintings are fake. Artificial intelligence is used to combine imagery pulled from Youtube with famous genres of art to generate each image. Meta-data is generated by algorithmically recombining meta-data from the Museum of Modern Arts database of works in its collection. An API can be pinged (when available) to pull down images and associated meta-data from the ODLKAP database. One use case of this API was for a site specific install of ODLKAP on Main Street in Lexington, Kentucky. ODLKAP database content was projected unto the front of the Downtown Arts Center from 8pm - 6am for one week, the paintings slowly dissolving into each other throughout the night.</p>
