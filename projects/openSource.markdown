  <h3 align="left">Open Source</h3>
  <p>Open Source is an game of pong taking place in both the physical and digital space. Players bodies are the paddles, Kinect cameras track the movement of each player to update the position of the pong paddle accordingly. Spectators can watch the traiditonal view of a pong game on a monitor, however players have only spatial audio and the position of the other player to track the game. The pong ball emits a constant tone and spatialized audio is used to create a sonic environment. Hopefully my description makes sense...Open Source was developed with John Meister.</p>
  <p>Open Source is installed at festivals and shows as a physical piece. Open Source has been shown at IndieCade in 2012, Studio 300, Scripts and Systems at LAL, and the Lexington Living Arts and Science Center</p>
