  <h3 align="left">Meaningful Registration</h3>
  <p>
    Meaningful registration is an ongoing project focusing on the question of what makes digital data meaningfully registered in the physical. Areas of focus include: aesthetic concerns relating to intersection of digital and physical, meaningful augmentations of our relationships and spaces, ramifications of augmented spaces, and embodiment of data.

  <h4 align="left">Experiments in Aesthetics of Meaningful Registration</h4>
  <p> Much of the research performed thus far for Meaningful Registration takes the form of artistic experiments and their documentation. Below is documentation from several of these experiments. These included experiments play with the quality of the relationship between the physical sign used to augment and the digital object that is registered in the world through augmentation.</p>
