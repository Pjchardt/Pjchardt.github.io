    <h3 align="left">Liminal--and other things you can learn from the internet</h3>
    <p>Liminal--and other things you can learn from the internet is an installation with video, custom software, and various televisions and podiums in specific arrangements, that explores ramifications of our disconnected and partitioned "selves"--we exist as nodes on various networks across both corporeal and digital domains. How do we experience others when we are partitioned across domains? Can we manufacture feelings of other and sense of shared space through manipulation of this partitioning? With these questions in mind, Liminal attempts to construct the feeling of another human’s presence in your space by inserting the dynamic shadow of a digital avatar unto the same wall as participant’s own shadows. The shadow is unexpected, as the video feed is an exact replica of the "no signal" graphic the projector displays when it does not have input. Taking advantage of the assumption that the image will then not be dynamic, our minds fill in the presence of another in the space; when we see the shadow. However, for the observant viewer, subtle gestures reveal the truth, that the space is manufactured and the user is being manipulated.</p>
