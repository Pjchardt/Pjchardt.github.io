    <!--<p>"ontopologies 2" is a 13:44 looping video rendered with the Unity Game Engine. The forms in the video are constructed by a feedback process that subverts the "expectations" of various algorithms from computer graphics and video game production. Data is fed through a series of algorithms, each output fed as input to the next. As the process unfolds the input data for the next algorithm diverges further from the data the algorithm expects. These forms are then combined through a process of purposefully glitching the process of real time graphics rendering by temporally divergent feedback loops. The piece is not meant to be read from begging to end as a linear work. For this reason, the video purposefully loops back on itself to blur a clear indication of start/end.</p>-->
