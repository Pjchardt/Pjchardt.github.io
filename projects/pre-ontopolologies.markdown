    <p style="background-color: #fff; text-align:left">Ambiguous human face slowly morphs in front of the viewer, eventually the face is frozen to the screen and another mask appears. Overtime the collection of frozen masks creates an abstraction of organic shapes behind the mask. When running the piece as a simulation the morphing simulation is randomized such that no two masks are morphed the same.</p>
