    <p>omur is a virtual reality application for Meta Quest headsets. The experience is an isolated room with six speakers. The speakers play a six channel soundscape of field recordings from Iceland. The audio is procedurally stretched and distorted using algorithms from video game production to craft an uncanny liminal space.
