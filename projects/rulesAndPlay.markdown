  <p>Annual Art exhibit examining games and how authored rules and systems can be used as a method of expression and criticism. I created Rules & Play in 2015 with the hope of raising awareness of the expressive and communicative power of games, systems, and rules. I envisioned an annual event to generate dialogue among the art, tech, and gaming communities. As well as creating Rules and Play, I acted as curator. In 2016, general responsibilities transitioned to the non-profit RunJumpDev, while I wrote the grant to establish the show as an annual event through funding from the LexArts Community Arts Development grant.</p>
