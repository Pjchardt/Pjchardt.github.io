    Footage from Nothing But Milk install at TechnoMEME 2 in Columbus, Ohio. The footage is admittedly not great, it doesn't show any interaction of text response by the app. The app works by receiving text "sacrifices" by users that are used to generate narrative fragments via the GPT-2 machine learning algorithm. The narrative fragments are then presented to the user in page format. Intermingled with this AI generated text is human generated text in the form of text "sacrifices" input by users at an earlier time. The app intentionally obfuscates who (or what) is writing the text fragments.
