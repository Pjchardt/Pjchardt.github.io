        <h3>Nothing But Milk</h3>
        <p>Nothing But Milk is a terminal interface that accepts linguistic sacrifices used in an algorithmic ritual to conjure narrative fragments of the internet. The project uses the GPT-2 machine learning algorithm. The authors of GPT-2 constructed the text corpus with which to train the neural network that is GPT-2 from reddit posts and links out of reddit, based on metrics such as upvote. This process embeds within GPT-2 a sort of "memory" of a part of the internet, of a specific time-frame. Narrative fragments are displayed back to users on the terminal, intermingled with human generated text--former text inputs at the terminal. The terminal does not explain who (or what) is writing the text fragments.</p>
