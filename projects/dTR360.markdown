  <h3 align="left">Deluxe Turbo Racing 360</h3>
  <p>Deluxe Turbo Racing 360 is a physical installation and digital game where Xbox 360 controllers are hacked and turned into physical vehicles. The rumble feature (haptic feedback system) of modern controllers is modified into a locomotion system by using the variable intensity of vibration on each side of the controller. The controllers become controllable game pieces players race to the finish line. A custom control unit was built for each team to control their controller vehicles. Deluxe Turbo Racing 36o was installed at ALT.CTRL.GDC in San Francisco for the Game Developers Conference in 2015.</p>
